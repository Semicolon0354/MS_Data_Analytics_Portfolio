Per the assignment instructions and due to the size of the Unity Project, rather than including an executable file, I've opted to include a video demonstration of the ml-agents final behavior.  The included video is a recording of the unity project in game play mode using the trained model for navigation.  Also included in this folder is a copy of the ml-agents script for the quadcopter (QuadCopterAgent.cs), a screenshot of the quadcopter asset in unity for demonstration of it's construction and a video demonstration of the drone in autonomous flight.  The trained navigation model (Orville_v1.0.onnx) and the configuration file used for training (QuadCopter.yaml) are also included.
